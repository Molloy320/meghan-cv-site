        <p>
          I’m Meghan Molloy, a creative, marketing, and technology professional
          who works at the intersection of strategy and execution. I specialize
          in turning big ideas into systems that actually work, whether that
          means building AI powered tools, shaping digital brands, or translating
          data into decisions that move the needle.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background spans digital marketing, analytics, product strategy,
          and creative direction, with a strong focus on emerging technology,
          especially generative AI. I’ve led cross functional initiatives,
          managed complex digital ecosystems, and built solutions that connect
          business goals with real world user needs.
        </p>

          Experience and Approach
        </h2>

        <p>
          I’ve worked across industries, from commercial and consumer facing
          brands to government adjacent and regulated environments. My roles
          often require both creative intuition and technical rigor, and I’m
          comfortable owning projects end to end, from strategy and concepting
          through implementation, testing, and iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
          I care deeply about clarity, usability, and impact. I don’t believe
          in building things just because they’re trendy. I believe in building
          things because they solve real problems, scale intelligently, and
          create value for both users and organizations.
        </p>

          Outside of Work
        </h2>

        <p>
          Outside of my professional work, I’m constantly learning,
          experimenting, and building. I enjoy exploring new technologies,
          creative projects, and ideas that sit just ahead of the curve.
          Curiosity drives everything I do, and I bring that mindset into every
          project I take on.
        </p>
